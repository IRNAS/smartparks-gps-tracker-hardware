# smartparks-rhino/lion-tracker-firmware
Smartparks Rhino and Lion GPS tracker firmware repository. This firmware is the first generation solution for multiple LoraWAN devices. The implementation is as straightforward as possible to ensure simple operation, however not suitable for very complex device operation taks which is implemented int eh second generation in a separate repository.

![Build](https://github.com/IRNAS/smartparks-rhino-tracker-firmware/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

WARNING: This documentation may not be up to date with the actual firwmare release.

# Requirements:
 * Modified Arduino Core for STM32L0
 * vscode or similar compile tool (Arduino IDE may break things)
 * this repository
 * TheThingsNetwork or other similar LoraWAN network server solution

# Operation
This device is a power-efficeint GPS tracker sending data via LoraWAN. There are three key messages being sent by the device:
 * `settings - port 3` - current device settings - only upon boot, change or request
 * `status - port 2 ` - (legacy, not enabled in latest version anymore) device status message being sent with the specified `status_interval` in minutes - recommended to do this every 24h
 * `gps - port 1` - gps location - gps packet is set based on the `settings` and various intervals defined there.
 * `status+gps - port 12` - device status message being sent with the specified `status_interval` in minutes - recommended to do this every 24h, combined with last gps position. Particularly useful if gps fix interval is longer then the status interval.
 * `gps log - port 11` - GPS positions are stored in flash memory, last 500 locations. Theya re requested with a command and sent out as SF7 packets of 200 bytes.

## Reed switch
The magnetic REED switch is put in place to put the device in hibernation for transport purposes or prior to installation. Removing the magnet will initialize the operation in 60s of removing it. Note that putting the device in hibernation performs a system reset and forces an OTAA rejoin if that mode is programmed.

## GPS data
The device reports GPS position with various mechanisms, these only expain fields related to GPS
* `status - port 12 `
  * `decoded.lat` - Latitude position
  * `decoded.lon` - Longtitude position
  * `decoded.gps_resend` - number status packets sent since last updated GPS position
  * `decoded.gps_on_time_total` - cumulative time in seconds since device reboot. This best correlated to the power consumption of the device.
  * `decoded.gps_time` - linux epoch time when the last GPS position has been acquired
* `gps - port 1`
  * `decoded.lat` - Latitude position
  * `decoded.lon` - Longtitude position
  * `decoded.alt` - Altitude above sea level
  * `decoded.satellites` - number of satellites acquired in the fix, expect >3 for 3D fix and >4 for 3D fix.
  * `decoded.hdop` - horizontal dillution of precision - expect <5 for normal operation, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_(navigation)
  * `decoded.time_to_fix` - time to fix of the device, depends on configuration, signal and how ofthen the fix is acquired. <5s is expected if fix every 5min, <15s is expected for fix every hour, <60s for cold fix
  * `decoded.epe` - estimated position error, this is configured as a target for every gps fix and the result show here is what happened actually. Normally in meters or feet. 50 is a good default, 100 will be very inaccurate fix, 10 is very accurate fix. Best advice is to keep this at 50, and set `gps_min_fix_time` to larger value, say 30 and the fix will be very good, epe is then expected to be about <10 in hotfix conditions.
  * `decoded.snr` - best satellite SNR value, good functioning device is in 40-50 range, <30 is critical, check device orientation and close by objects.
  * `decoded.motion` - high if the gps position has been triggered by movement, subject to configuration
  * `decoded.gps_time` - linux epoch time when the last GPS position has been acquired
* `gps log - port 11 ` - 5 positions per packet of this info
  * `decoded.lat` - Latitude position
  * `decoded.lon` - Longtitude position
  * `decoded.gps_time` - linux epoch time when the last GPS position has been acquired

## GPS acquisition logic
The GPS system is configured by defining the `gps_periodic_interval` - time between fixes periodically and `gps_triggered_interval` - time between fixes if device is in active mode based on `gps_triggered_threshold` and `gps_triggered_duration`.
* `gps_periodic_interval` - gps periodic fix interval in minutes, 0 disables it - 240 is a good default
* `gps_triggered_interval` - gps triggered interval in minutes, 0 disables it - 0 is a good default
* `gps_triggered_threshold` - the amount of G-force of the movement to trigger a fix, assume 10 as a safe default
* `gps_triggered_duration` - the time in seconds that the accelerometer needs to detect motion before it triggers a fix, assume 10 as a safe default
* `gps_cold_fix_timeout` - cold fix timeout in seconds - 120 is a good default
* `gps_hot_fix_timeout` - hot fix timeout in seconds - 30 is a good default
* `gps_min_fix_time` - minimal fix time - 5-15 is a good default
* `gps_min_ehpe` - minimal ehpe to be achieved - 50 is a good default
* `gps_hot_fix_retry`(0-255)- number of times a hot fix is retried before failing to cold-fix - 5 is a good default
* `gps_cold_fix_retry`(0-255) - number of time a cold fix is retried before failing the gps module. `gps_settings.hot_fix` needs to be enabled for this settings to be used - 2 is a good default, 255 is a special value indicating the cold fix never times out.
* `gps_fail_retry` - number of times gps system is retried before putting it in failed state, only 0 can be used currently
* `gps_settings` -
  *  `bit 0` - 3d fix enabled - 1 is agood default
  *  `bit 1` - linear backoff upon fail (based on interval time) - 1 is a good default
  *  `bit 2` - hot fix enabled - 1 is a good default
  *  `bit 3` - fully resolved required - 1 is a good default
* `gps_accel_z_threshold` - accelerometer threshold for z value, such that gps does not trigger on wrong orientation. Typically GPS up is a negative accel Z value, good option to set this to is -500, 0 to disable this check

Theory of operation is as follows:
* GPS is initialized when first used, either by periodic or triggered interval, both can be used at the same time. GPS starts in the cold fix mode and will try to get the fix for the `gps_cold_fix_timeout` duration, if successful and hot-fix is enabled in general settings, then it will try all consequent fixes for the `gps_hot_fix_timeout` duration. If a fix fails to be acquired for `gps_hot_fix_retry` number of times then it reverts to cold fix for the `gps_cold_fix_timeout` duration for `gps_cold_fix_retry` times. When that is exhausted the gps goes to `gps_fail_retry`, which can currently only be 0, so practically the GPS will be disabled upon the reset of the device.

`gps_settings` allows for 3D fix to be enabled, linear backoff upon a failure of a cold or hot fix, meaning tha the defined `gps_periodic_interval` or `gps_triggered_interval`will be multiplied by the number of fails that have occured. This sonserves the battery by allowing the device to get out of a bad spot. Hot fix should alwazy be enabled unles very clearly needed otherwise, likewise for fully resolved.

`gps_min_ehpe` is the principal factor to configure how fast the fix can be acquired and how good it is. A general value of 50 is a good starting point, 100 makes the fix fast but very inaccurate, under 20 the fix times get very very long and drain the battery. Leave at 50 unless you know what you are doing. `gps_min_fix_time` forces the fixes not to be too short, acquiring a bit more of almanach. If you can afford battery wise, 15s is a good default

`gps_accel_z_threshold` is the value set as accelerometer z value above which gps can trigger, meaning the tracker is pointing to the sky. Negative hangles are handled as well such that the more negative number then the threshold, then trigger occurs.

## GPS logging
5kB of EEPROM is available for GPS logging. At 10B per position, this means we can store last 500 positions. Upon request, these positions are sent via LoRaWAN.

### GPS data storage format
 * `lat` - 3 bytes lattitude
 * `lon` - 3 bytes longtitude
 * `time` - 3 bytes of time - for fixes we are mostly interested in 60s precision. Timestamp is in format (linux epoch time in seconds - 1600000000 (starting date Sept 13th 2020))/60. This gives us 30 years of runtime.
 * `fix_info` - 1 byte
   * 1 bit - motion triggered flag
   * 3 bit - epe/12 (0-100 typical, value ranges 0-7), any value higher maps to higest value
   * 4 bit - ttf/5 (0-200s typical, value ranges to 0-15), any value higher maps to higest value

## RF tuning DTC 
Trackers include a DTC tuning component, which can be used to tune the antenna accordingly.

Send to RF port 30 the message based on `encoder_rf_settings_json.py` and set `type=1` to receive vswr values based on capacitor value. 

Send to port 92 a single byte value of what DTC should be, this gets stored into eeprom. Use with caution.

## ADS fence monitor calibration

Send to port 93 a 2 byte value with the calibration factor multiplied by 10000;
For example the sensor is returning 1300 (pulse_voltage), we wish to calibrate this to 1800. Calculating from this 1.3846 factor, multiplied is 13856, convert this to hex 0x3616. Send this via downlink.
To reset the values send 2 byte value 2710 (hex 0x2710) to port 93.

## Pulse counting mode
The pulse counting and reporting mode is built to enable interfacing an external piece of electronics, for example a camera trap and detec actions as well as to control an ouput.

Pulse input does the following:
- Increment the field in status packet `pulse_count`
- When `pulse_count` is greater then `pulse_threshold`, send status packet and reset the field. Set to 0 to send data on every pulse.
- The device trigger sending at most often on `pulse_min_interval` in seconds, maximal value 255s.

Pulse output does the following:
- Replicate the input pulse to the output
- When the sending conditions are met, the output pulse pin is turned on for `pulse_on_timeout` seconds.

Configuration variables controlling this:
* `pulse_threshold` - how many pulses must be received to send a status packet
* `pulse_on_timeout` - how long is the pulse output on after threshold reached
* `pulse_min_interval` - how often at maximum can a device send a packet on pulse event

The use-case of above implementation is somewhat universal, however tailored at monitoring SD card activity in camera traps and similar devices and turning on these SD cards if they have WiFi capability.

## LoraWAN comissioning/provisioning
The device povisioning is done with a separate sketch that uploads the keys to the EEPROM. Then the device gets the actual firmware. This is implemented such that the same firmware build can be distributed publicly and does not contain any key information.

If the keys are incorrect or not provisioned on the device, then the device fill revert to the fallback provisioning specified in the firwmare. Note this is nto secure and you can modify it per project, so no devices should be ever using this. If you see a device responding as fallback you can try to remotely reset it and that is as much as you can do, otherwise you need to reprogram.

Default fallback:
 * `devAddr` = "26011D63"
 * `nwkSKey` = "9518E9E68D1476BC3386409B76476208"
 * `appSKey` = "7972E2A484F76EF7B579D641D0BFEBD5"

## LoraWAN data
See `decoder.js` which is rather human-readable for description of values being sent.

## LoraWAN commands
There are a number of single-byte commands specified for critical device control mechanisms. WARNING: Commands need to be sent unfonfirmed as they may reset the device, loosing the reply.

Implemented commands to be sent as single byte to port 99:
 * `0xaa` - Sent the current settings
 * `0xab` - Triggers system reset
 * `0xac` - GPS system reset, restarts GPS without system reset
 * `0xde` - Resets LoraWAN stored settings in EEPROM and forces a re-join
 * `0xd0` - Drop-off command for the drop-off mechanism
 * `0x11` - Request the device GPS position log - 5 positions per packet, all available positions in sequence
 * `0xf1` - Clear GPS position log - use if necessary, but log simply stores last 100 positions and overwrites itself

## Tools
There are a few tools available to make using this solution easier, namely:
 * `decoder.js` - TheThingsNetwork V2 payload decoder to jet nicely formatted json data from the binary messages
 * `encoder_settings_json.py` -Python scrip to prepare the json structure for settings to be sent to the device
 * `encoder.js` - TheThingsNetwork V2 payload encoder, accepting the above created json

# Building firwmare
The firmware needs to be built with two key things configured:
 * `board.h` - specfying board pinout and functions
 * `lorawan.h` - selecting ABP or OTAA activation

## Power consumption

### System functions 0x00 - all disabled - sleep only with WDT running
Measured consumption 2uA on average, excludes sending Lora messages.

### System functions 0x01 - GPS periodic enabled
Measured consumption 15uA on average, excludes sending Lora messages

## Node-RED integration

Node-RED framework is used as bridge between The Things Network and InfluxDb-Grafana stack.
It formats TTN messages so they can be saved into Influx database and plotted by Grafana.

### port 11 messages

In this port we get several locations in one message, that we have to display as separate points on the Grafan graph so it makes sense to explain how we do it.

For this port message we have to read 5 different locations, each one with its own timestamp, format it and sent it into Influxdb node. Influxdb enables us to write several points at once, as seen on [node-red documentation website](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-influxdb) about Influxdb.

> **If msg.payload is an array of arrays, it will be written as a series of points containing fields and tags**.

That means that we need 5 arrays, each will contain two objects. First object will contain value fields that we would like to write (lat and lon in this case), second object will contain dev id as usual. We also need time value in first object because each lat and lon pair has different timestamps.
Injected epoch timestamp needs to be 19 digits in order to work with Grafana.

Below code creates functionality that is described above:

```javascript
//clear up payload, we will get our data from payload_fields
msg.payload = []
    
// Locations actualy contains a string not an js object so we need to parse it first.
var parsed_locations = JSON.parse(msg.payload_fields.locations)
    
//iterate through payload_fields, there should be only 5 packets, but we can make this universal
for (i = 0; i < parsed_locations.length; i++)
{
       
    // Make sure that time is correct length so that grafana accepts it
    var epoch_number = parsed_locations[i].time
    var epoch_length = epoch_number.toString().length
    var power_of_ten = 19 - epoch_length
    var correct_grafana_epoch = epoch_number * Math.pow(10, power_of_ten)

        
    //fill up packet that we will push into our msg.payload object
    var lat_lon_packet = [{
        port:   msg.port,
        lat:    parsed_locations[i].lat,
        lon:    parsed_locations[i].lon,
        time:   correct_grafana_epoch,
        rssi:   max_rssi
    },
    {
       devId: msg.dev_id
    }]
    
    msg.payload.push(lat_lon_packet)
}
```
